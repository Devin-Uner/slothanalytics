			<h1> How it all works...</h1>
			<p>Our solution to worldwide illness is simple: use intellect rather than brute force. Our algorithms utalize state of the art neural networks to diagnose and learn over time. If they are incorrect, they adapt, if they recieve new data, they will learn. Every time the page is loaded the neural network gets a little bit more accurate, a little bit smarter. Every computer using our software acts as a training camp of sorts, where the algorithm uses a trivial amount of the users processing power to improve itself. Over time, with millions or even billions of connected devices, its potential is limitless. <br>
			The neural network has three layers. One layer takes in the input and processes it, another layer acts as a secondary processing area, and the third processes data one last time before returning the result.</p>
